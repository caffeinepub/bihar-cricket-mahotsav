  "summary": "Frontend changes implement admin-route guarding/redirects, add a mobile-friendly clipboard utility, add React Query hooks for admin/bootstrapping/caller principal lookup, and update the admin login/troubleshooting page to use these hooks. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the backend exposes the required bootstrap-detection query method (admin count/any-admins) that the frontend now calls.",

      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes a query method that reliably indicates whether any admins exist (or returns an admin count), and the frontend uses it to drive the bootstrap UI state.",
      "reason": "Frontend now calls `actor.isSystemBootstrapNeeded()` to drive the 'Become the First Admin' CTA, but the backend diff excerpt is truncated and does not show any added/updated query method implementing this bootstrap/admin-count check.",
