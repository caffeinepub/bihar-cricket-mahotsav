  "summary": "The diff updates the Principal ID retrieval to use the backend actor method `getCallerIdAsText()` via a React Query hook that is keyed/enabled based on the current Internet Identity principal, and the Admin Login page invalidates relevant queries after login/logout to refresh auth-dependent state. From the truncated snippets, core intent of REQ-17/REQ-18 appears addressed, but some UI-specific acceptance criteria (e.g., visible Retry button/error text behavior) cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary.",
